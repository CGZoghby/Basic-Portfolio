        <p> So today I found an adorable, tiny, little bunny (abbreviated TLB for ease), 
            barely moving, huddled against a concrete sidewalk guard. This TLB had an issue that I was not
            disciplined enough to diagnose, but my heart fell for it and I had to take care of it. 
        </p> <p>
            There is a wildlife hospital near me, but it's crewed by volunteers and funded through donations;
            their voicemail said they were maxed out but passed me the number for animal control. 
        </p> <p>   
            Enter Jim. Jim lives in my apartment complex and takes care of the multi-generational colony of 
            feral cats living there. Jim found the TLB, and immediately pledged to take care of it and nurse it 
            back to health. Jim is my hero and a champion for humanity.
